About the test
==============
For testing I used two very basic "hello world"-like applications, trying to serve the same HTML, with a little layout handling on both sides. 
For Rails I chose Thin server which is more or less on par with Passenger+NginX stack I use in production (and I know Thin is beeing used in production enviroment). For Lift I took the Jetty server which came out of the box and I read Jetty is often being chosen over Tomcat for production.



After testing
=============
Lift is indeed faster (~93%) in a low number of requests <7000, but something happens between 7000 and 8000 requests which puts lift into trouble (Threadpool full?). 

Another finding is that the CPU usage of Lift was much higher, than the one of Rails, even in a low number of requests. (see CPU usage screenshots)



System specification 
====================
* Mac OsX 10.6.2
* 2,8 GHz Intel Core i7
* 8GB Ram 
* ruby 1.8.7 (came with Mac OsX) / scala 2.7.7

(I also tried another 2,53 GHz Core 2 Duo - 4 GB Ram Machine, looks pretty much the same, just takes longer)



Testing Lift
============
$ mvn jetty:run

(I got the jsessionid by making an request to the server and then reading out the cookie. I also made more than 100.000 requests before the test.)
